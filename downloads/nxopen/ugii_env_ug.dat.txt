# 
#
#  The following is the list of published environment variables for
#  Windows NT systems.  
#
#  There is now an environment variable, UGII_ENV_FILE, that can be used to
#  locate user's customizations.  This variable can be set in the environment, 
#  and must point to a valid environment file.  This file should only contain
#  the user's customizations.  The search for the environment files
#  proceeds as follows:
#
#  1.  If the file $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\ugii_env.master exists, the values are
#      read.  This is a list of environment variables that the system manager
#      wishes to lock down to prevent changes.  Values in this file supercede
#      values set in the environment, so that users can not change the default
#      values as set by the system manager unless they have access to the file.
#
#  2.  User customizations of enviroment variables are loaded.  The first file
#      found in this sequence is used:
#     
#      a. If the environment variable UGII_ENV_FILE is set, then the file
#         it refers to is loaded.  This file should just contain user
#         customizations.
#      b. The ugii_env.dat file from the directory where ugraf.exe was started,
#         e.g. the user's current directory.
#      c. The ugii_env.dat file from the user's home directory.
#      d. The ugii_env.dat file from the $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii directory.
#  3.  Files are read in from manifests as specified by the Applications that
#      have been loaded.  These files will be listed in the syslog and contain
#      mostly variables required to locate the applications.
#  4.  The NX default environment variable list is read in from 
#      $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\ugii_env_ug.dat.
#
#  The remainder of the variables are defined in this file and are divided
#  into the following sections:
#
#     DISK FILES        - variables relating to *.ugf files that are used.
#     MODELING          - variables relating to modeling
#     MACHINING         - variables relating to machining products
#     CGM               - variables relating to the CGM product
#     ERROR and HELP    - variables relating to error and help files
#     USER FUNCTION     - variables relating to user function
#     MISCELLANEOUS     - miscellaneous variables used by NX
#     USER EXITS        - variables relating to user exits.
#     SMD               - variables relating to sheet metal design
#     ROUTING           - variables relating to the UG/Routing product
#     GRIP BATCH        - variables relating to grip batch
#     DISPLAY DRIVERS   - variables relating to the display drivers
#     PLOTTER           - variables relating to plotter configuration.
#     TRANSLATORS       - translators & process specific applications.
#     SCENARIO          - variables relating to the SCENARIO product
#     MACHINE DEPENDENT - variables with  platform specific settings.
#     DESIGN TOOLS      - variables relating to design tools products, such as 
#                         Check-Mate, Requirements and Issue Management
#
# The following platform variable should not be changed.  It is defined
# here for legacy purposes.

UGII_LOCALIZATION_FILES=${UGII_BASE_DIR}\localization
#
#  UGII_LOCALIZATION_CUSTOMIZED_FILES points to the location of any customized
#  localization files.  Note that this should specify a directory which has
#  the $UGII_LANG directories underneath for any customized languages.  So for
#  example if you have some German customizations and you set 
#  UGII_LOCALIZATION_CUSTOMIZED_FILES=w:\my_shared_translations
#  then NX would look for files in the w:\my_shared_translations\german
#  subdirectory.  This allows customization support for multiple languages.
#  Note that files in UGII_LOCALIZATION_CUSTOMIZED_FILES are preferred to files
#  in UGII_LOCALIZATION_FILES.  This lets a customer correct the text files
#  released by NX.

#
# You can set environment variables to define your user defined feature environment.
# These variables are described in more detail in the Modeling on-line help.
#
# Under Teamcenter Engineering, all user defined feature environment variables are
# optional.  We recommend setting:
# UGII_UDF_IMAN_TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER is the top level folder in Teamcenter Engineering
#    where your user defined features reside. Use this to improve browse performance.
#
# Under Teamcenter Engineering, these may be set to access legacy user defined feature libraries:
# UGII_UDF_IMAN_WITH_NATIVE_DATABASE=yes allows access to user defined features outside
#    the IMAN database. It will override your ability to access hierarchical folders
#    of user defined features in Teamcenter Engineering.
# UGII_UDF_IMAN_LOCAL_DATABASE_FILE defines the location of your local user defined features.
#    A sample database file is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\udf\udf_database.txt
# UGII_UDF_IMAN_GLOBAL_DATABASE_FILE defines the location of your global user defined features.
#    Its format is similar to the UGII_UDF_IMAN_LOCAL_DATABASE_FILE.
# UGII_UDF_DEFINITION_FILE is a file that determines your hierarchical library structure.
#    A sample definition file is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\udf\dbc_udf_ugmgr.def
# UGII_UDF_EVENT_FILE is the TCL file that accesses the database files. We do not recommend
#    changing this file that is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\udf\dbc_udf_ugmgr.tcl
#
# Native Unigraphics user defined feature environment variables that optionally can be set are:
# UGII_UDF_DEFINITION_FILE is a file that determines your hierarchical library structure.
#    A sample definition file is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\udf\dbc_udf_ascii.def and
#    we recommend its use.
# UGII_UDF_DATABASE_FILE defines the location of your user defined features.
#    A sample database file is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\udf_database.txt
# UGII_UDF_LIBRARY_DIR, used in sample UGII_UDF_DEFINITION_FILE, defines the full path of your user
#    defined features directory so that a relative path can be defined in the database file for cgm
#    and part locations. It has an old version UDF_LIBRARY_DIR.
# UGII_UDF_EVENT_FILE is the TCL file that accesses the database files. We do not recommend
#    changing this file that is located at $UGII_BASE_DIR\ugii\udf\dbc_udf_ugmgr.tcl

# UGII_UDF_LAYER_ORIGINAL specifies that all objects created by a new UDF instance will be by default added to the

#
# UGII_INOP_SE_IMPORT_ONLY_DESIGN_PART
#
# This environment variable is for Solid Edge interoperability. If the value of this

# By default the value is 0. i.e., by default all the representations - design,simplified
# and flat are imported.
#
UGII_INOP_SE_IMPORT_ONLY_DESIGN_PART=0

#
# UGII_SE_NO_ASSEMBLY_FEATURE
#
# This environment variable is for Solid Edge assembly-level features.
# The default is to always allow assembly-level features to be loaded when they are encountered,
# but that imposes some restrictions on what features can be loaded from the component parts of
# the assembly.  With assembly-level features active, only the main representation from the 
# component parts is loaded; other representations and construction geometry are not loaded.
# This will cause problems if the component parts only contain construction geometry.  If in your
# case you are interested in the construction geometry of the piece parts and not interested in
# assembly-level features, uncomment the following line.
#UGII_SE_NO_ASSEMBLY_FEATURE=1

#  This variable controls where the system looks for

#
#  UGII_KF_USER_CLASS_DIR can now be a path where path

#
#  UGII_KF_USER_CLASS_DIR=${HOME}\dfa_files

#  DRAFTING
#
#  The following variables are used by the DRAFTING Product
#
#  When UGII_ANG_DIM_DISALLOW_FLIP is set to anything, angular dimensions with
#  manual text/arrow placement will not be allowed to "flip" when their origin
#  moves closer to the opposite angle. Automatic text/arrow placement will
#  operate as usual, as will all other dimensions, and manual angular
#  dimensions when this is not set.
#UGII_ANG_DIM_DISALLOW_FLIP=
#
#  UGII_ANNOTATION_DIR allows a set of company standard note files to be
#  placed in a specific directory which be displayed as the default directory
#  for the Annotation Editor Include and Save As functions.  If it is desired
#  not to have individual user modify or add notes to this directory using the
#  Save As function, the files and the directory, respectively, can be made
#  read only.  By default, this environment variable is not set, and this
#  default setting will result in the user's current directory being displayed
#  in the file selection box for these two Annotation Editor functions.
#UGII_ANNOTATION_DIR=
#
# UGII_TAB_LABEL_FORMATS_FILE contains custom templates for tabular labels.
UGII_TAB_LABEL_FORMATS_FILE=${UGII_BASE_DIR}\ugii\tab_label_format_file.xml
#
#  UGII_PMI_SYMBOL_LIBRARY_DIR specifies the location of the Unigraphics PMI symbol
#  library containing the special .sym.prt files and icon files for each symbol.
UGII_PMI_SYMBOL_LIBRARY_DIR=${UGII_BASE_DIR}\ugii\symbol\PMI_Symbols
#
#  Drafting text has never supported tab (\t, \011) or line feed (\n, \012) characters.
#  Consequently, these characters are no longer allowed in Drafting text.
#  These characters should neither be entered interactively in the Annotation Editor
#  nor included in text read from a file such as text read by the "Insert from File" function
#  in the Annotation Editor, or a file specified for the GRIP NOTE command.
#  To support legacy file text that includes these characters, the
#  UGII_DRAFT_REMOVE_UNSUPPORTED_CONTROL_CHARACTERS can be set to either TRUE or true.
#  Setting this variable to true will cause all tab and line feed characters included
#  in the text to be automatically removed.  To use this environment variable simply remove
#  the "#" comment character from the front of the declaration below.
#
#  To have tab and line feed characters permanently removed from a note template file:
#      1) run Unigraphics with UGII_DRAFT_REMOVE_UNSUPPORTED_CONTROL_CHARACTERS=TRUE,
#      2) Open the Annotation Editor
#      3) Use the "Insert from File" function to read in the note template file.
#         A status message should be displayed indicating that control characters were removed.
#      4) You can optionally try placing the note to verify that an
#         "Invalid text in Annotation Editor" message is not reported and that the note can
#         be created.
#      5) Use the "Save As" function to save the note template text back to the file
#         without the control characters.
#
#
#UGII_DRAFT_REMOVE_UNSUPPORTED_CONTROL_CHARACTERS=TRUE
#
#  In earlier versions of Unigraphics (pre-V10), the ability to represent
#  annotation as text boxes was supported.  This capability has been removed
#  from the interactive system.  Although supported through UG/Open, there is
#  often a desire to reset this setting in any part that is loaded.
#
#  To turn of the text box setting for any part that is loaded, enable the
#  environment variable below.
#
#UGII_DISABLE_V9_TEXT_BOX_DISPLAY=TRUE
#
# In V18.0.4 a fix was submitted to extend the dimension line under all the

#  The Physical Material Library uses several environment variables to locate its program and
#  data files. The defaults coded here point to the UG kit directories.
#  Customers may override the variables to point at different versions of the files.
#
#  A legacy Material Library database is supported by core UG and it is a 
#  text-based row-column file
#
#  The files are:
#      phys_material.def      Database meta definition file
#      phys_material.tcl      Database access program
#  Text-based only:
#      phys_material.dat      The default, text based material library.
#  
#  Two layers are provided for the def and tcl files. 
#
#  If the override def & tcl files are in a single directory,
#  set UGII_USER_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR to point at the directory. 
#  If any of the files are not found in the UGII_USER_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR, 
#  the Library will then search the second layer for the missing file. 
#
#  The second search layer uses UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR. 
#  The def file is keyed to UGII_LANG to allow native language translation.
#  E.g., %UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR%\%UGII_LANG%\phys_material.def
#
#  The tcl program is searched first in UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR, then searched in yet another
#  directory, UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_PATH. Having 2 variables allows the same tcl program to be
#  used for all NLM def versions.
#
#  By intent, the customer can set the UGII_USER_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR and leave UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR
#  as the back-up, the default. Customers can also set UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR at the risk of
#  losing the back-up path when anything goes wrong.
#
#  The actual database files are accessed by the tcl program. 
#
#  The text-based version looks for phys_material.dat in UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DATA_DIR.
#  There is no first layer search for the dat file.
#
#  By intent, advanced customers may edit/customize the tcl programs. The search for the database
#  may be customized by editing the tcl program.
#
#  UGII_USER_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR, UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR, UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_PATH may each be
#  coded as path strings. That is, more than on directory name separated by the ';' character.
#
#  The default settings:
#
#if FILE ${UGII_BASE_DIR}\ugii\materials\${UGII_LANG}
UGII_PHYS_MATERIAL_LIB_DIR = ${UGII_BASE_DIR}\ugii\materials\${UGII_LANG}\

#  ROUTING Application Environment Variables
#
#  The Routing Applications are  Routing Electrical, Routing Mechanical,
#  and Routing Logical.
#  The environment variables in this section apply to one or all of
#  these applications.
#
#  Variables that apply to a single application include the name
#  of the application in the variable name.  Variables that apply to
#  all applications have ROUTING or ROUTE in their names.
#
#  The UGII_ROUTE_UGMANAGER_MODE variables specifies if the Routing
#  administrative files should be loaded from Teamcenter or not.  It
#  can have values of TRUE or FALSE.
#
#  If set to TRUE then the Routing administrative files will be loaded
#  from Teamcenter. If FALSE then the default mechanism of looking for
#  these files in the kits or in the directory specified by environment
#  variables will be used.
#
#  The Routing administrative files are loaded upon entering a Routing
#  application.  It consists of the following files:
#       1. Application view         - .xml
#       2. XML Schema file          - .xsd

#  are updated to include the Z values of the newly visible component.
#  If you do not want the Z clipping planes to change when a component
#  becomes visible, set this variable to 1.
#
#UGII_DISABLE_UPDATE_Z_CLIP_FOR_COMPONENT=0
#
#  Starting with NX 6.0.4, the use of the "Rotate Point", also known as
#  the "Center of Rotation", has been extended so that rotation will occur
#  around this point (when defined) for View -> Orient, View Popup -> Orient View,
#  F8 (Snap to nearest orthographic view orientation),
#  Home (Snap to TFR-TRI view orientation), End (Snap to TFR-ISO view orientation),
#  F4 (Snap to nearest view orientation, when UGII_FKEY_DYNAMICS=1).
#  View -> Operation -> Rotate and View -> Set to WCS.
#  The following variable, if set, will cause NX to revert to limit the
#  use of the "Rotate Point" to what it was before NX 6.0.4.
#UGII_DISABLE_EXTENDED_CENTER_OF_ROTATION_USE=1
#
#  Starting with NX 8.0, a new option has been added to the Preferences ->
#  Visalization View/Screen page: "High Precision Rotation".  When enabled,
#  rotation using mouse motion will be changed so that you can obtain a more
#  precise setting of the rotation angle, making it easier to look at the model
#  from exactly the desired angle.  This is done by dividing the rotation angle
#  by a factor, whose default value is 8.0.  A value of 1.0 corresponds to the
#  value when this oprion is not tured on.  You can change the factor from its
#  default value by seting the following environment variable, which has a
#  range of 0.1 to 25.0 inclusive.  Using values less than 1.0 makes the rotation
#  less precise but faster than with the option disabled
#UGII_ROTATION_PRECISION_VALUE 8.0
#
#  Starting with NX 8.0.3, an environment variable has been added to allow
#  omitting the recording in a journal file of objects to be unblanked by
#  a "Show All" operation.  This will be useful when the Customer Default setting
#  for "Part Name Style Attribute" under Assembies -> Miscellaneous is set to some
#  user-defined attibute.  There may be some other similar conditions.  If so,
#  and if "Show All" must show a large number of objects under these conditions,
#  its performance may be slow.  To improve the performance, set
#  UGII_DONT_JOURNAL_UNBLANK environment variable to 1.  Note that when this
#  environment variable is set, you will not be able to record the "Show All" in
#  a journal file, and Redo of "Show All" will not be available.
#UGII_DONT_JOURNAL_UNBLANK=1  
#
# UGII_PDF_LINE_STYLE
# This variable will force the cgm2pdf utility program to use the line
# style specified.  The default behavior is to use a round capping, so that
# lines have a rounded end point.  You may set this to "bevel", "miter" or
# "round" to produce the desired line end styles.
# UGII_PDF_LINE_STYLE=round
#
# UGII_PDF_LINE_WIDTH
# This variable will force the cgm2pdf utility program to generate all lines
# with zero width if it is set to "pixel".  This will create a PDF file where
# all lines have a single pixel width no matter what scale they are zoomed
# to.  This option is useful when the line width does not matter, and you
# want to be able to zoom into the PDF and not see very wide lines.  The
# default if this variable is not set is the use the line width as specified
# by the CGM file.
# UGII_PDF_LINE_WIDTH=pixel
#
# UGII_PDF_FONTNAME
# This variable will set the default fontname to be used by the cgm2pdf utility.
# This font will be used if a truetype font matching the font named in the 
# cgm file is not found on the system.  It is quite likely that the NX fontname
# will not be found as a TrueType font, so this font becomes the default for all
# text.  Since the visible text is stroked with polylines, the font used is not
# very important, as the hidden text is only there so that searching for text will 
# work.  However for non-ASCII data, the default font needs to include all of the 
# Unicode characters that are normally output.  The default used if this variable
# is not set is Arial.  MS Mincho should be used for Japanese, as that font contains
# the Japanese characters.
# UGII_PDF_FONTNAME=Arial
#
# UGII_PDF_ACROBAT_VERSION
# This variable will set the PDF library (and thus Acrobat) compatibility version.
# It will default to whatever is the latest version supported. Customers can set
# this to a prior version, and the cgm2pdf.exe tool will produce files compatible
# with that version. This may cause some features to be unavailable, so this should
# be used with extreme caution. Valid values are 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7.
